## by Aaron Rosenblatt

### I built a shop for my photojournalism website, http://www.aaronrosenblattphoto.com, which is designed and operated through Sam Exhibit. The shop was built using the MERN stack, with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. The e-commerce platform uses React's Context API. The Context API is managed with global state so the a site passes reducers, and extracts data from the store and dispatches actions.
